# Thesis Management System Backend Server

## Installation and Booting
From this folder, run the following commands:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
This will install all the dependencies and start the server on port 8080.

### Configuration

A configuration file is present in `src/config.json`. 
Currently it contains the following configuration options:
- `BACKEND_SERVER_PORT`: Port on which the backend server will run

### Starting the server in development mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the server in development mode using _nodemon_, which will automatically restart the server when any changes are made to the source code.

## Testing
To run the tests, run the following command:
```bash
npm test
```
This will run all the tests in the `tests` folder.

Other tests can be added in the `tests` folder. The test files should be named as `*.unit.test.js`.
They will be automatically picked up by the test runner when running the above command.

## Code Coverage
To generate the code coverage report, run the following command:
```bash
npm run coverage
```
This will generate a code coverage report in the `coverage` folder.
